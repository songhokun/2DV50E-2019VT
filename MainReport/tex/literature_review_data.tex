This chapter presents the result of a systematic literature review on studies related to DNS Privacy. Only the studies with Privacy improvement suggestions were chosen to present.
The mitigative methods were classified into three groups, based on the methods' approach to reducing the privacy risks.
%The resonation with the classification choice follows in the next section.

Studies shown in Table \ref{channel} attempted to secure the communication channel of the DNS query.
In other words, these studies suggested applying Encipherment mechanism to deliver Connection Confidentiality as X.800 defines \cite{x800}.
Applying channel encipherment methods for securing DNS queries mitigates the privacy risks by giving trust to the chosen recursive resolver.

Table \ref{content} shows a list of studies which aimed to minimise privacy leaks by addressing the content of the packets that were generated in the DNS query process.
%The approach can be seen as metaphors of Least common mechanism and Isolation as described in security design principles.

There were several pieces of research and design proposals of new architecture which would replace the current DNS system. These are found in Table \ref{architectures}.
