This section provides limitations of the DNS privacy enhancing methods presented in the previous chapter.
The investigations of the limitations are presented in the same order as the previous categorisation. In the first section, limitations of channel encipherment is introduced.
Afterwards, the focus shifts to information redactions and proposals for structural shifts.

\subsection{Risk areas of DNS Privacy}
DNS Privacy methods could further be analysed based on the which privacy risk these address. S. Bortzmeyer identified risk area of DNS privacy in RFC 7626 as the followings \cite{rfc7626}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data in the DNS request
    \item On the wire
    \item In the servers
    \item Re-identification and other Interferences
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Two phases of DNS Query process}
For the conciseness of further analysis, the communication channel (transport channel) of DNS are abstracted into two phases or paths based on the DNS Query process.

\textbf{Phase 1} refers to step 1 and 10 of Figure \ref{queryprocess}. These two steps are performed in the DNS Query process when stub resolver queries a domain name to the recursive resolver and the recursive resolver replies to the stub resolver.
Channel-wise, it is denoted as a \textbf{stub-to-resolver link}.

\textbf{Phase 2} refers to the steps in the Figure \ref{queryprocess} where a recursive resolver finds the final answer to the queried address, by recursively reaching to concerning authoritative servers. In other words, the channel that the rest of the steps is performed is called \textbf{recursive-to-auth link}.

\subsubsection{Insufficient measurements on recursive-to-auth link}\label{recursive-auth-limitations}
The distinction of the two phases are noteworthy, as the current implementations that preserve DNS hierarchical structure do not secure all communication paths towards all involved parties of the DNS resolving.
As an example, the majority of the methods do not encrypt communications on Phase 2 (recursive-to-auth link) in contrast to Phase 1 (stub-to-resolver link).
The fact that an authoritative server having a one-to-many server-client relationship from the recursive resolvers is the major obstacle of applying encryption on Phase 2.

As a further explanation of one-to-many relationship being an obstacle, DoH \cite{rfc8484} and DoT \cite{hu2016specification} use Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol \cite{rfc7858} for encryption. In the case an authoritative server process multiple TLS session, it is likely to end up exhausting its computational resources \cite{bhople2012server}, similar to a Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack situation. The internet draft ``Next step for DPRIVE: resolver-to-auth link \cite{I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-step-2}'' discusses the aforementioned challenges.

Furthermore, authentication mechanisms are missing on Phase 2 \cite{I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-step-2}, and the lack of authentication of the authoritative server may potentially enable a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).
% There are proposal of utilising TLS 1.3 and

\subsection{Observation on packets' size}
Siby et al. presented their preliminary study results of observing DNS-over-HTTPS traffics \cite{siby2018dns}.
They set two types of experiments: single-query and multi-query. Multi-query referes to simulating to load a web page and let the browser makes follow up queries of the embedded contents of a website.
Their simulation of single-query visit reveals that DNS query-response size tuple results in being distinct per each queried address and when applied multi-query simulation, the number of uniqueness associated to each DNS query-response increased \cite{siby2018dns}.

If more researchers make similar observations, and if the conclusion holds, it becomes a concern since the result indicates that privacy attackers could observe the encrypted query-response set of packets size and induce the actual query despite of not decrypting the packets.

\subsection{Privacy leaks by Transitive trust}
Shulman demonstrated that `straightforward application of the encryption alone may not suffice \cite{Shulman:2014}' for protecting DNS Privacy due to possible disruption of DNS Availability and privacy leaks caused by `transitive trust \cite{Ramasubramanian:2005}'.
Shulman further analysed transtive trust as (1) \textit{fan-out} and (2) \textit{chain-length}.
Chain-length refers to ``A number of name servers involved in a resolution of a record that initiates the chain'' and fan-out as ``number of (transitive-trust) chains involved in a resolution of a domain name'' \cite{Shulman:2014}.

Transitive trust at authoritative servers possess a potential risk of revealing the query and client. While \textit{DNS QName minimisation} \cite{bortzmeyer2016dns} limits the scope of the query name leaks, the extensified usage of DNS in Content Delivery Network (CDN) context \cite{WANG2018235} may have increased the chain-length and it leads to the intercoperation issues \cite{Huque-QNAME-Min-analysis}.

\subsection{Availability concerns on Oblivious DNS}
There are several criteria to define availability. The criteria for defining availability introduced by Pfleeger are (1) having a timely response to a given request, (2) ensuring fair allocation of resources and (3) being fault-tolerant \cite{securityincomputing}.
This report defines availability as a chosen recursive resolver to resolve the queried address and provide the correct IP address promptly.

High availability of DNS is important since web activities cannot be initiated without name resolution (as mentioned in Section \ref{dns-introduction}). High performance (performance refers to having a low latency) of DNS is also an important factor to consider because DNS resolutions are a significant cause of having log Web waits \cite{cohen2003proactive, jung2002dns}, and it has a notable impact on `User-perceived latency'.

However, security concerns arise in terms of availability for \textit{Oblivious DNS}, as ODNS operations require ODNS-authoritative servers in addition to the conventional recursive resolvers and imposing such design creates a new `central point of failure \cite{minutes-102-dprive}'.
Also, questions concerning assuring confidentiality of the keys used in ODNS and issues with fallback have not been answered \cite{minutes-102-dprive}.

\subsection{Prevalence of hierarchical DNS}
Although the primary focus of the study is made on Domain Name resolving part, DNS resolving is only a portion of the entire DNS, as there are diverse actors (such as administrators, domain owners) involved in the system.
Figure \ref{dnsactors}, which is presented by SUNET \cite{SUNET-DNS}, illustrates the involved machines and servers of the system as a whole.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics*[width=1\columnwidth]{img/DNS-maskinvara}

    \caption{Parties involved in DNS as a whole \cite{SUNET-DNS}}
    \label{dnsactors}
\end{figure}

In the figure, sections are vertically divided.
The figure in the first column represents organisations or individuals that desire to acquire a new domain name.
The third column of the figure demonstrates administrators of delegation on each autonomous domain hierarchy.
Legacy of the system are often neglected in attempts of securing the domain name resolution process, which is presented in green colour in the figure. 

The naming hierarchy of the DNS ``ties into systems such as the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) \cite{akamai-dns-architecture}'', and architecture of decentralised DNS, such as NameCoin \cite{loibl2014namecoin}, may have not considered the PKI structure in its design.

\subsection{Privacy limitations of Namecoin}
Preserving user privacy in Namecoin requires ``replication of the full blockchain at the user's end system \cite{grothoff2017nsa}'' and performing such received a criticism that it ``may be impractical for some devices \cite{grothoff2017nsa}.''
The criticism can be interpreted as applying blockchain did not add significant value, in terms of preserving the privacy of users, as privacy breaches in DNS resolving process could also be addressed if DNS records could be replicated on a client's system even in the existing hierarchical system. 

\subsection{Privacy limitation of GNS}
Authors of the GNS claim that domain resolving process of the GNS is private because ``queries and responses are encrypted \cite{grothoff2017nsa, wachs2014censorship}.''
However, its confidentiality is vulnerable for `confirmation attack' if ``the adversary knows both the public key of the zone and the specific label \cite{wachs2014censorship}.'' Note that the label refers to an entry in a petname system. 

\subsection{Integrity limitations on decentralised approaches}
Ensuring the integrity of the DNS record is significant, and it is evident from `phishing attacks \cite{ariyapperuma2007security, ollmann2004phishing}'.
Per contra, radical protocol design proposals may harm the integrity of the DNS records, as its proof-censorship or legal-attack-proof designs may enable everyone can claim the legitimacy of ownership of the specific domain.

Solutions using DHT in its design may put the system vulnerable to possible Sybil attacks \cite{6503215, SitE2002Scfp}.
Sybil attacks are a type of attack scenario where an attacker `subverts the reputation system by creating a considerable amount of pseudonymous identities \cite{TRIFA20141135}' `in the absence of identification authority \cite{douceur2002sybil}.'

Interventing the malvaceous records are more challenging than the hierarchical structure of the current DNS system in the decentralised design, and this could lead to concerns of enabling phishing attacks.
Enhancing confidentiality aspects of DNS security is important but it should not compromise the integrity aspect.

\subsection{Opportunistic security}
Stenberg, a contributor for client implementation of DNS-over-HTTPS in Firefox, mentioned common Secure-DNS challenges as follows \cite{daniel-doh}: (1) discovery of which recursive resolver to use (2) probing of service (3) opportunistic encryption and (4) blocking force-downgrade.

In the case of Firefox's implementation of DNS-over-HTTPS, the mode of operations are (1) race, (2) Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) first, (3) TRR only and (4) shadow mode \cite{firefox-doh-engine}.
Race and shadow mode stands for issuing DNS queries simultaneously on both conventional (insecure) DNS resolving method and Secure DNS method.
In DNS privacy's perspective, these modes are excluded for analysis.

Using TRR first mode attempts to resolve DNS query over DoH and when it fails after pre-set limited of counts, it fallbacks to the conventional DNS resolver.
At the current stage, a preliminary experiment (described in Appendix \ref{protocol-verification}) showed that a limited amount of DNS query still fallbacks to the conventional resolver, and reveals the website a user intended to visit.
