Pfleeger introduces three aspects of Information security: sensitive data, affected parties, and controlled disclosure.
We will discuss privacy issues related to the DNS on different subjects.

\subsection{Affected subjects}
We classify subjects as private persons, and organisations. Organisations are further divided into a large organisation which operates own directory server with DNS, and the smaller organisations that do not operate DNS resolvers in its network.

\subsection{Sensitive information}

For organisations, of their information assets especially copyright (expression of the idea), trade secret, and privileged information may be seen as sensitive information \cite{securityincomputing}.

\subsection{Scenarios}
