    \label{dns-methods-classification}
\end{figure}

In addition to the classifications made in the above tables, the identified methods were further sorted into two approaches based on the designers' view of the existing DNS model.
Figure \ref{dns-methods-classification} demonstrated two trees, and of the two trees, the largest tree showed methods which preserve the current hierarchical DNS structure, and the other represented proposals taking a radical approach; suggesting a structural change to decentralised DNS.

Figure \ref{dns-methods-classification} resulted in having two labels of (A) and (C). (A) stood for categorisation proposed in this study and leaves with (C)-label were the methods proposed by other research groups.  

\subsection{Encipherment of communication channels}
Communication channel encrypting methods, as presented in in Table \ref{content}, attempted to alleviate privacy risks on the wire.
Methods encrypting the data transport channel were sorted into ones utilising current internet standards or the others proposing customised protocols.

\textit{DNS-over-TLS(DoT)} \cite{rfc7858}, \textit{DNS-over-HTTPS(DoH)} \cite{rfc8484} and \textit{DNS-over-DTLS} \cite{rfc8094} are the techniques that reuse the proven Internet standards for securing the connection channel between a stub resolver and a recursive resolver.
Technologies in this field could be understood as encapsulations of DNS operations with minimal changes to the existing Internet protocols.
%Methods with preserving the hierarchical DNS had a tendency to prioritise interoperability with the existing domain infrastructure.
%Also, it was observed that in the case of applying channel encipherment solutions, methods tended to incapsulating DNS operations with minimal changes to the existing Internet protocols.

The methods also partially address the risks of re-identification depends on who the subject of the attacker is.

\subsection{Information redactions}
Applying the encipherment mechanism on the communications among DNS servers has limitations that these only shifted the trust towards the Recursive resolver.
In the meanwhile, design enhancements of packets' content reduce the risks of Data in the DNS request and data leaks in the servers.
Query Name (QNAME) minimisation \cite{bortzmeyer2016dns} and Oblivious DNS \cite{annee-dprive-oblivious-dns-00} are the techniques of this category.

\textit{QNAME minimisation} reduces the query leaks on higher authoritative name server chains, by presenting only relevant part of a domain name for an authoritative server to answer, instead of querying with FQDN.
It makes only the relevant name server to acquire the full QNAME and query type. Therefore it reduces privacy risks on Phase 2.
Although the risk of data leaks still present in the last chain of the authoritative NS, this is less likely to happen unless administrators of the domain name have a malicious intent to exploit users' privacy.

    \label{odnsoverview}
\end{figure}
\textit{Oblivious DNS (ODNS)} aims to decouple any association of a client IP address and DNS query content and no single party should be able to see both \cite{annee-dprive-oblivious-dns-00}.
For this to work, it requires a special stub resolver and an ODNS authoritative resolver where the client creates a unique session key on each session to encrypt its DNS query and append 'odns' TLD.
Figure \ref{odnsoverview} presents an overview of the ODNS and the illustration is fetched from its project page \cite{ODNSwebsite}.

However, security concerns arise in terms of availability, as ODNS operations require ODNS-stubs and imposing such design creates a new `central point of failure \cite{minutes-102-dprive}'.
Also, questions concerning assuring confidentiality of the keys used in ODNS and issues with fallback have not been answered \cite{minutes-102-dprive}.

\subsection{Architectural shift}
In the previous section, securing recursive-to-auth link is seen challenging due to the hierarchical structure of the DNS.
Studies that aim towards decentralised, often imposing peer-to-peer (P2P) implementation are free from the limitations caused by the hierarchical structure.
Examples of such solution are Namecoin \cite{loibl2014namecoin} and GNU Name System (GNS) \cite{grothoff2017nsa, wachs2014censorship}.

\textit{Namecoin} \cite{loibl2014namecoin} is described as ``timeline-based system that relies on a P2P network to manage updates and store the timeline \cite{grothoff2017nsa}'', and it settles down any commits related on `key-value mapping' by transactions that are published in an append-only hash chain (a.k.a. blockchain) \cite{kalodner2015empirical}.

\textit{GNU Name system (GNS)} is `privacy-preserving' domain name lookup system which takes a radical deviation from the conventional domain resolvers, by utilising P2P network and Distributed Hash Table (DHT).
DHT provides ``support for an operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node \cite{stoica2001chord}'', such property is used in GNS domain lookup (resolving) process. 
In other words, GNS utilise ``distributed storage of DNS records in P2P overlay networks \cite{wachs2014censorship}''. In addition to the DHT, GNS is built upon a petname system \cite{stiegler2005introduction} and utilise Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI).
