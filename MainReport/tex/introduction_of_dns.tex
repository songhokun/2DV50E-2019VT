\subsubsection{DNS}
Every activity on the web most likely begins with entering a human-friendly domain name in the web-browser. Once we enter a domain name for visiting a website, DNS resolves the address to an actual Internet Protocol Address of a web server which hosts the website. In case multiple websites are hosted on a single server, the entered fully qualified domain name(FQDN) is used to differentiate virtual hosts on a web server \cite{virtual24host}. Therefore, DNS is a critical component of the Internet.

\subsubsection{DNS Servers}\label{dnsservers}
DNS servers consist of four types: Stub resolver, Recursive resolver, Authoritative server, and Forwarding DNS server. Resolvers refer to programmes that obtain information from name servers upon clients' requests \cite{rfc1034}.

Stub resolver is a resolver that serves as an entry-point of querying DNS from applications and directs search request to the nearest recursive resolver \cite{rfc1123}. As it cannot complete domain name resolution by itself, stub resolver is dependant on a recursive resolver \cite{rfc8499}.

The recursive resolver is a server which receives a DNS query from a stub resolver and gets the final answer to the query, by (1) answering from its local cache or (2) sending queries to other DNS servers \cite{rfc8499}. After a recursive resolver has sent a query request to other authoritative name servers, it is expected for the resolver to store the answer as a \textbf{local cache}. It is the first server in DNS query flow that contacts other servers to get the answer for the client. 

Authoritative (name) server is a server that has ``authority over one or more DNS zones \cite{rfc8499}'' and ``can answer queries without needing to query on other servers as it knows the content of the queried DNS zone by local knowledge \cite{rfc2182}.''

DNS forwarding server is a server that forwards queries to recursive resolver or other forwarding servers. It does not perform a query process for the stub resolver.
\subsubsection{DNS Query process}
Due to the hierarchical structure of the Domain Name System with delegations of authorities \cite{rfc1591}, getting the exact IP address of a given domain name involves several DNS servers. Figure \ref{queryprocess} shows an example of querying ``saimei.ftp.acc.umu.se.''.

In the diagram, steps 2 and 3 returns top-level-domain(TLD) from the root servers. The steps 4 and 5 obtain the Authoritative name server of Swedish TLD. The .SE TLD returns name server of Ume\aa\ University in steps 6 and 7. In the last, the name server of umu returns IPv4 address (A record) of the given address, so that recursive resolver can provide the answer to the stub resolver. These steps are performed under the assumption that none of the queries is cached. 
\subsubsection{EDNS(0) and Client Subnet}
The extension mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) is specified in RFC 6891. EDNS allows both DNS servers and client to send ``larger DNS packet than the original 512 octet limit \cite{rfc6891}'' so that it benefits of utilising larger size. It makes sending long IPv6 address and possible DNSSEC signatures. As of February 2019, major DNS resolver operators have started not to support non-EDNS compliant servers. 

EDNS(0) provides several options, and one of the options is Client Subnet(ECS) feature, as described in RFC 7831 \cite{rfc7871}. When ECS is used, recursive DNS servers provide a truncated client IP address in its DNS queries to the upstream authorities to permit ``topologically localised answers for Content Delivery Networks (CDN) \cite{kintis2016understanding}''.
