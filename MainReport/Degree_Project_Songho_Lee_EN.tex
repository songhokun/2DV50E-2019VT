\noindent Current usage of the DNS system is the most significant loophole of Internet users' privacy, as all queries and answers for resolving web address are not protected in most cases. % Thesis statement, background description
Lack of confidentiality in the DNS system enables everyone who has control of the path between a user and DNS resolver can collect someone's usage pattern and fingerprint him and filter his access to specific websites. % Motivation
Despite a single solution for addressing privacy risks in all stages of the DNS query process does not exist, the report acquaints several Internet standardisations for DNS privacy that are complementary to the existing DNS system and verifies that implementation of these brings significant enhancement of users' privacy.
%The report explores existing methods to enhance DNS Privacy and sets up a series of experiments to verify implementations of such methods for privacy enhancement. % Description of problem explored

\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes what Doname Name System (DNS) is, and how the legacy design of DNS has become a privacy threat. Before discussing the privacy risks of DNS, the background section introduces relevant structure and mechanisms. Knowledgable readers in DNS and Client subnet function may go to section \ref{problemformulation}.

\subsection{Background}
Digital transformation has brought things used to be done in real life decades ago to the online. At work, people have a video conference call instead of a business trip if not necessary. For shopping goods, people fill in credit card numbers for cross-border payments rather than visiting a bank branch to issue paychecks. In other words, the stage where people work now has been shifted to cyberspace in recent decades, and the Internet has become an essential part of everyday life.

Despite the ubiquitousness of the Internet, users' activities online are collected under pervasive monitoring by different actors.
Pervasive monitoring means ``widespread attack on privacy \cite{rfc7258}.'' Information collected in such action could lead to a breach of users’ privacy, by re-identifying users based on traffic \cite{herrmann2010analyzing}, or could become aids for launching an active form of attacks, such as masquerade and Denial of Service (DoS).
Unfortunately, the insecure architecture of Domain Name System allows the pervasive monitoring, and thus it should be mitigated. Before discussing the privacy problems of DNS, we introduce DNS and its components which are important to address.

\input{tex/introduction_of_dns.tex}

\subsection{Related work}
The project accredits pioneer research of ``DNS Privacy Considerations (RFC 7626) \cite{rfc7626}'' which has provided theoretical foundations in analysis of DNS privacy. 
As of 2019, there are several studies presented to mitigate privacy issues based on the analysis. These studies are later presented in Chapter \ref{surveyresults}.

P. Werneck and J.H.C. van Heugten presented surveys of DNS privacy-enhancing methods. P. Werneck evaluated approaches to improve the privacy of DNS and stated the limitations of identified approaches \cite{werneck2014dns} in 2014. J. Heugten evaluated existing solutions to enhance DNS Privacy in 2018 in his study \cite{van2018privacy}. As standardisation of DNS-over-HTTPS is recently finalised \cite{rfc8484}, a study from van Heugten reflects more recent changes.

\subsection{Problem formulation}\label{problemformulation}
Currently, almost all DNS traffic is sent in clear text \cite{rfc7626} over the UDP protocol \cite{tcp2014analysis}, and it makes DNS queries vulnerable to being hijacked or used to filter users' traffic.
All participants of the DNS query process, as illustrated in Figure \ref{queryprocess}, transmit messages intensively, and these are in plaintext.
It is also noteworthy that all participating authoritative name servers receive the same questions, although it is not necessary for Authoritative servers in higher hierarchies in the process to know all the complete domain address in question.

S. Bortzmeyer has analysed that particular fields in DNS packet \cite{rfc1035} such as Query name (QNAME) and Source IP address reveal ``communication relationships \cite{rfc7626}''.
These series of observations indicate that there are risks of information leakage in following places: (1) tapping on the wire ``between the stub resolvers and the recursive resolvers'', and (2) information leaks in the servers.
The following research questions are formulated having regards to the privacy breaching circumstances.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{tabular} {|p{1.2cm}|p{12.8cm}|} \hline
        \textbf{RQ1} & Which benefits would DNS Privacy bring to different parties? \\ \hline
        \textbf{RQ2} & Which are the use cases that the exisiting DNS Privacy enhancement methods could not address? \\ \hline
        \textbf{RQ3} & Which combination of technologies would be suitable to address the limitation of the current status?\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Research questions}
\label{researchquestions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Motivation}
Most of the internet activities begin with DNS query, hence DNS is vital. Notwithstanding the importance of DNS, designers of the current DNS protocol have not taken consideration of ``confidentiality of protocol metadata'' \cite{wachs2014censorship}.
Therefore DNS queries reveal communication flows, and this property of DNS protocol is used in different contexts by different actors. Examples of usages are traffic monitoring for network management or limiting the influence of malicious websites by DNS Footprinting of malware \cite{stoner2010dns}, or detecting malware infections \cite{lemos2013got}.

Other exemplary usages of this property of DNS are nation-state surveillance \cite{NSA-SIGINT}, privacy-unfriendly activities of commercial sectors \cite{weaver2011redirecting}, and illegal actions by criminals. Surveillance affects individuals to possess stress and anxiety \cite{oulasvirta2012long}, and behavioural changes like self-censorship \cite{rfc6973}. RFC 6973 connotes that Privacy harms involve ``harms to financial standing, reputation, solitude, autonomy, and safety \cite{rfc6973}'' of individuals.

S. Farrell et al. state in RFC 7258 that allowing monitoring by benevolent actors and defending privacy against nefarious actors do not hold hand in hand, as the actions required to achieve both, regardless of the motivations, are indistinguishable \cite{rfc7258}.
Disadvantages incurred by lack of DNS privacy significantly overweight advantages, and therefore DNS privacy should be mitigated in any feasible practices.

\subsection{Objectives}
The following objectives are set to answer the research questions and transform the tasks into the smaller pieces, and reasonings on each objective follow below. Hereafter several words are shortened for the ease of denotation, such as an objective as O and a research question as RQ. Table \ref{objectives} summarises the objectives.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{tabular} {|p{1.2cm}|p{12.8cm}|} \hline
        \textbf{O1} & Analyse different end-users' privacy infringements when not having DNS Privacy\\ \hline
        \textbf{O2} & Explore the state of arts in mitigative methods to enhance DNS Privacy \\ \hline
        \textbf{O3} & Identify areas which the selected methods could not address. \\ \hline
        \textbf{O4} & Analyse alternative approaches to mitigate the current limitations.\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Objectives}
    \label{objectives}
\end{table}

RQ1 aims to explore benefits by having DNS privacy on a different group of people.
As it could be challenging to motivate benefits of having privacy when obscurity prevails, O1 is defined to analyse scenarios when the privacy is violated caused by having insecure or exposed DNS queries.

RQ2 is to find use cases of the existing DNS privacy mitigative methods. However, in order to discuss use cases, the state of these methods need to be examined. Therefore, O2 is set to explore the state of arts of the methods and O3 is set to identify areas for  improvements.

RQ3 attempts to provide useful interventions by finding a combination of technologies to overcome the limitation of the current DNS Privacy enhancement. For serving the purpose, O4 discusses possible approaches to using other technologies.

\subsection{Scope/Limitation}
The project has a focus on improving the privacy part, from the security perspectives. In other words, reflected to a Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability(CIA) triad, enhancing Integrity and availability perspectives are less prioritised in the current project. Issues and challenges of DNS security as a whole may be found in other studies, such as one conducted by Ning Hu et. al.\cite{ning2017dnssecurity}. 

\subsection{Target group}
The project aims to provide insight on DNS Privacy for Internet users and recursive resolver providers for improving users' privacy.
%Here you outline which target group that might be interested in your work. If you, for example, do a project about software architectures, a target group can be professional developers and architects that work with similar software systems as the system you investigated.

\subsection{Outline}
The majority of scientific reports follow in Introduction, Methods, Results, Analysis and Discussion(IMRaD) pattern. However, the project chose to use a design science method and therefore it has an inverted structure of results and analysis. An analysis is made first to describe the design constraints and results (or design proposal) are presented afterwards. 

\newpage
\section{Method}\label{Method}
This chapter describes the chosen scientific methods to answer the research questions (Table \ref{researchquestions}) and meet the objectives (Table \ref{objectives}).
The study used scientific methods of systematic literature review and design science. Controlled experiments were also partially used to verify several statements made in the study. Sections follow to motivate the choice of a scientific method for meeting objectives.
\subsection{Systematic literature review}
A systematic literature review was performed to accomplish O2, which is to study mitigative methods of DNS privacy. Although a recently published article provided an overview of DNS Privacy enhancing methods \cite{van2018privacy}, performing systematic literature review was necessary to eradicate possible biases and to minimise opportunities of missing suitable solutions.

A search criterium was set to list articles that cited RFC 7626 from a database Google Scholar to make the review process systematic. RFC 7626 is chosen, as its analysis had provided a clear insight of DNS privacy issues \cite{rfc7626}, and since around four years had passed after its publication, it was anticipated that fellow researchers have tried to solve or list risks identified in the article.

For inclusion criterium, references of the found articles were further examined, as there were chances of missing to address well-established solutions possibly because the methods had been introduced before publishment of RFC 7626.

Exclusive criteria were set to have the contents of the articles to be relevant to the defined problem. Therefore, any solving other security aspects of DNS, such as availability but not addressing the privacy problems were excluded.

\subsection{Design Science}
Design science ``creates and evaluates Information Technology artefacts to solve identified organisational problems \cite{von2004design}'', and it has strong relevance in addressing O3 and O4 which are to identify the area that studied DNS Privacy methods could not address and analyse alternative approaches to overcome the limitations.

To refine problem statements for the existing practice, a literature review is made to analyse privacy infringement scenarios on diverse user scenarios, as defined in O1.

\subsection{Controlled Experiment}
A controlled experiment is applied to verify whether the suggested design artefact addressed the limitations of current DNS Privacy enhancing methods found in O3 or not. Conducting a controlled experiment fulfils one of the guidelines of design science which requires ``thorough evaluation of the artefact \cite{von2004design}''.

\subsection{Reliability and Validity}
The study is seen to have reliability on the results of the literature review, as the same effect will be derived by performing a search as described in the previous section. As Appendix A includes the source code of the experiment scripts, a similar result is expected to be derived by other researchers as well. 

The project deployed its experiments in a virtualised environment to minimise unforeseen factors that would impact performance measurements.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}
Discussing ethical considerations has less significance in the chosen methods, as no real data of any physical persons is collected without the consent.
However, it can be questioned whether it is adequate to elaborate privacy breaching scenarios in details to use the information for formulating problems for the design science method.
Despite the concerns, as the project aims to improve the problematic scenarios of not having sufficient privacy enhancements, describing the problematic situations as-they-are is necessary.

\section{Design Constraints}
In the previous chapter, privacy-enhancing studies were analysed in terms of contribution to privacy enhancements on end-users.
In this section, factors other than the privacy perspective are highlighted.

\subsection{CIA-triad}
Achieving every aspect of CIA-triad often are not feasible, as enhancing one dimension may interfere with the other dimensions.

\subsubsection{The integrity of the DNS records}
Ensuring integrity of the DNS record is significant, and it is evident from `phishing attacks \cite{ariyapperuma2007security, ollmann2004phishing}'.
Per contra, radical protocol design proposals may harm the integrity of the DNS records, as its proof-censorship or legal attack proof designs may enable everyone can claim the legitimacy of ownership of the specific domain.
Furthermore, solutions using DHT in its design may put the system vulnerable to possible sybil attacks \cite{6503215, SitE2002Scfp}.
Interventing the malvaceous records are more challenging than the hierarchical structure of the current DNS system in the decentralised design, and this could lead to concerns of enabling phishing attacks.
Enhancing confidentiality aspects of DNS security is important but it should not compromise the integrity aspect.

\subsubsection{The availability of the DNS Service}
There are several criteria to define availability. The criteria for defining availability introduced by Pfleeger are (1) having a timely response to a given request, (2) ensuring fair allocation of resources and (3) being fault-tolerant \cite{securityincomputing}.
This report defines availability as a chosen recursive resolver to resolve the queried address and provide the correct IP address promptly.

High availability of DNS is important since web activities cannot be initiated without name resolution (as mentioned in Section \ref{dns-introduction}). High performance (performance refers to having a low latency) of DNS is also an important factor to consider because DNS resolutions are a significant cause of having log Web waits \cite{cohen2003proactive, jung2002dns}, and it has a notable impact on `User-perceived latency'.

\section{Appendix 1}
The section presents a set of Python script that can potentially used in verifying the proof of concept presented in this sutdy.
Secetions follow with code for processing a web site list, script to simulate the web traffic and the common base code for above functions to work.
Analysing and capturing the generated web traffic is not in the scope of the section.

\subsection{Processing frequently visited web domain list} \label{processweblist}
The website list is fetched from Alexa top one million global chart and further classified depends on Top-Level-Domains (TLDs).
Below is code for a script to convert the Alexa list into a dictionary format.
\inputpython{../Selenium/process_web_list.py}{1}{30}

\subsection{Script for automating the web traffic simulation}
Selenium is the web automation test tool\cite{holmes2006automating}, which is typically used to test web applications. Selenium can be used to visit a list of websites for simulating DNS queries. In the script below, the selenium was incorporated with Firefox Gecko driver to control the web browser through a Python script.

Python 3.5 and higher, Pip3 is required. It is anticipated that Python packages such as selenium and json are also installed on the system. A Gecko driver needs to be reachable in OS' PATH environment. This code assumes that Firefox browser is installd on the local PC.
