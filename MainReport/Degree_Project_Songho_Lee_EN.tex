\noindent Current usage of the DNS system is a significant loophole of Internet users' privacy, as all queries and answers for resolving web address are not protected in most cases.
The report elaborates which Internet users' privacy interests exist, and presents the current technologies to enhance DNS Privacy through a systematic literature review.
The report also explores the limitations of the current practices and presents several proposals such as DNS-over-Tor and methods to change the trusted recursive resolver to mitigate current limitations periodically.
%Despite a single solution for addressing privacy risks in all stages of the DNS query process does not exist, the report acquaints several Internet standardisations for DNS privacy that are complementary to the existing DNS system and verifies that implementation of these brings significant enhancement of users' privacy.
%The report explores existing methods to enhance DNS Privacy and sets up a series of experiments to verify implementations of such methods for privacy enhancement. % Description of problem explored

\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes what Domain Name System (DNS) is, and how the legacy design of DNS has become a privacy threat. Before discussing the privacy risks of DNS, the background section introduces relevant structure and mechanisms. Knowledgable readers in DNS and Client subnet function may go to section \ref{problemformulation}.

\subsection{Background}
Digital transformation has brought things used to be done in real life decades ago to the online. At work, people have a video conference call instead of a business trip if not necessary. For shopping goods, people fill in credit card numbers for cross-border payments rather than visiting a bank branch to issue paychecks. In other words, the stage where people work now has been shifted to cyberspace in recent decades, and the Internet has become an essential part of everyday life.

Despite the ubiquitousness of the Internet, users' activities online are collected under pervasive monitoring by different actors.
Pervasive monitoring means ``widespread attack on privacy \cite{rfc7258}.'' Information collected in such action could lead to a breach of users’ privacy, by re-identifying users based on traffic \cite{herrmann2010analyzing}, or could become aids for launching an active form of attacks, such as masquerade and Denial of Service (DoS).
Unfortunately, the unsecure architecture of Domain Name System allows pervasive monitoring, and thus it should be mitigated.
Before discussing the privacy problems of the DNS, DNS and its components are introduced, since these are important to address.

\input{tex/introduction_of_dns.tex}

\subsection{Related work}
The project accredits pioneer research of ``DNS Privacy Considerations (RFC 7626) \cite{rfc7626}'' which has provided theoretical foundations in analysis of DNS privacy. 
As of 2019, there are several studies presented to mitigate privacy issues based on the analysis. These studies are later presented in Chapter \ref{surveyresults}.

P. Werneck and J.H.C. van Heugten presented surveys of DNS privacy-enhancing methods. P. Werneck evaluated approaches to improve the privacy of DNS and stated the limitations of identified approaches \cite{werneck2014dns} in 2014. J. Heugten evaluated existing solutions to enhance DNS Privacy in 2018 in his study \cite{van2018privacy}. As standardisation of DNS-over-HTTPS is recently finalised \cite{rfc8484}, a study from J. Heugten reflects more recent changes.

While the current report attempted to describe privacy infringements situations related to the DNS operations in scenarios, the threat model of Pervasive surveillance as a whole is elaborated on in RFC 7624 \cite{rfc7624}.

\subsection{Problem formulation}\label{problemformulation}
Currently, almost all DNS traffic is sent in clear text \cite{rfc7626} over the UDP protocol \cite{tcp2014analysis}, and it makes DNS queries vulnerable to being hijacked or used to filter users' traffic.
All participants of the DNS query process, as illustrated in Figure \ref{queryprocess}, transmit messages intensively, and these are in plaintext.
It is also noteworthy that all participating authoritative name servers receive the same questions, although it is not necessary for Authoritative servers in higher hierarchies in the process to know all the complete domain address in question.

S. Bortzmeyer has analysed that particular fields in DNS packet \cite{rfc1035} such as Query name (QNAME) and Source IP address reveal ``communication relationships \cite{rfc7626}''.
These series of observations indicate that there are risks of information leakage in following places: (1) tapping on the wire ``between the stub resolvers and the recursive resolvers'', and (2) information leaks in the servers.
The following research questions are formulated, having regards to the privacy breaching circumstances.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{tabular} {|p{1.2cm}|p{12.8cm}|} \hline
        \textbf{RQ1} & Which benefits and possible disadvantages would DNS Privacy bring to different actors? \\ \hline
        \textbf{RQ2} & Which are the areas that the existing DNS Privacy enhancement methods could not address? \\ \hline
        \textbf{RQ3} & Which combination of technologies would be suitable to address the current limitations?\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Research questions}
\label{researchquestions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Motivation}
Most of the internet activities begin with DNS query, hence DNS is vital. Notwithstanding the importance of DNS, designers of the current DNS protocol have not taken consideration of ``confidentiality of protocol metadata'' \cite{wachs2014censorship}.
Therefore DNS queries reveal communication flows, and this property of DNS protocol is used in different contexts by different actors. Examples of usages are traffic monitoring for network management or limiting the influence of malicious websites by DNS Footprinting of malware \cite{stoner2010dns}, or detecting malware infections \cite{lemos2013got}.

Other exemplary usages of this property of DNS are nation-state surveillance \cite{NSA-SIGINT}, privacy-unfriendly activities of commercial sectors \cite{weaver2011redirecting}, and illegal actions by criminals. Surveillance affects individuals to possess stress and anxiety \cite{oulasvirta2012long}, and behavioural changes like self-censorship \cite{rfc6973}. RFC 6973 connotes that Privacy harms involve ``harms to financial standing, reputation, solitude, autonomy, and safety \cite{rfc6973}'' of individuals.

S. Farrell et al. state in RFC 7258 that allowing monitoring by benevolent actors and defending privacy against nefarious actors do not hold hand in hand, as the actions required to achieve both, regardless of the motivations, are indistinguishable \cite{rfc7258}.
Disadvantages incurred by lack of DNS privacy significantly overweight advantages, and therefore, DNS privacy should be mitigated in any feasible practices.

\subsection{Objectives}
The following objectives are set to answer the research questions and transform the tasks into the smaller pieces, and reasonings on each objective follow below. Hereafter several words are shortened for the ease of denotation, such as an objective as O and a research question as RQ. Table \ref{objectives} summarises the objectives.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{tabular} {|p{1.2cm}|p{12.8cm}|} \hline
        \textbf{O1} & Investigate different end-users' privacy infringement in scenarios without DNS Privacy\\ \hline
        \textbf{O2} & Explore the status of mitigative methods to enhance DNS Privacy \\ \hline
        \textbf{O3} & Identify areas which the selected methods could not address. \\ \hline
        \textbf{O4} & Explore alternative approaches to mitigating the current limitations.\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Objectives}
    \label{objectives}
\end{table}

RQ1 aims to explore benefits by having DNS privacy on a different group of people.
As it could be challenging to motivate benefits of having privacy when obscurity prevails, O1 is defined to analyse scenarios when the privacy is violated caused by having insecure or exposed DNS queries.

RQ2 is to find use cases of the existing DNS privacy mitigative methods. However, in order to discuss use cases, the state of these methods need to be examined. Therefore, O2 is set to explore the state of arts of the methods and O3 is set to identify areas for improvements.

RQ3 attempts to provide useful interventions by finding a combination of technologies to overcome the limitation of the current DNS Privacy enhancement. For serving the purpose, O4 discusses possible approaches to using other technologies.

\subsection{Scope/Limitation}
The project has a focus on improving the privacy part, from the security perspectives. In other words, reflected a Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability(CIA) triad, enhancing Integrity and availability perspectives are less prioritised in the current project. Issues and challenges of DNS security as a whole may be found in other studies, such as one conducted by Ning Hu et al.\cite{ning2017dnssecurity}. 

\subsection{Target group}
The project aims to provide insight on DNS Privacy for Internet users and recursive resolver providers for improving users' privacy.
However, it is anticipated that readers comprehend Internet protocol suite such as TCP/IP \cite{rfc1122}.
%Here you outline which target group that might be interested in your work. If you, for example, do a project about software architectures, a target group can be professional developers and architects that work with similar software systems as the system you investigated.

\subsection{Outline}
The majority of scientific reports follow in Introduction, Methods, Results, Analysis and Discussion(IMRaD) pattern.
This report is also in line with the IMRaD pattern. After the method chapter, four chapters follow, and each chapter presents the result of each objective incrementally. In other words, Chapter \ref{scenariosresult} presents the result of O1, Chapter \ref{surveyresults} presents O2 and it follows up to Chapter \ref{alternativeresult} which describes the result of the last objective, O4.
Afterwards, the discussion chapter follows where relevant ethical discussions and consequences of DNS Privacy can be found. In the last, the conclusion chapter summaries the discussions and results of all research questions to which the thesis answered.

There are two appendixes in this report.
Appendix \ref{scriptcode-appendix} introduces a python script that can be used in the future studies, and Appendix \ref{protocol-verification} presented a controlled experiment conducted during the project to acquaints with one of DNS Privacy enhancing method.
The conducted experiment, however, does not provide an answer to the objectives set in the study; it provides a reference to one of the arguments.
Therefore, the experiment is presented in the appendix for providing an angle in discussing the limitations of the current practice.

\section{Conclusion}
As its first research question, the study aimed to explore the benefits and disadvantages of DNS privacy to different actors. The study demonstrated harms caused by lack of DNS privacy both on the individual level and organisational level. Consequently, identifying privacy threats showed the benefits of having DNS Privacy. However, the disadvantage of DNS Privacy has not been found sufficiently.

For the second research question of identifying areas that the existing DNS Privacy enhancement methods could not address, the study demonstrated the limitations of DNS Privacy technologies based on the categorisation the study made. Channel encipher methods were not sufficient on Phase 2, and information redaction approaches raised availability concern while proposing architecture change of DNS showed integrity issue. 

As of answering the last research question, which is to identify a suitable combination of technologies to overcome the limitations, the study evaluated using Tor and potential usage of ongoing DHCP standardisation for frequently changing trusted recursive resolver.
The end-users, whose interests are analysed in the report, could refer to the report to meet their interests, and the approach used in the analysis could be referred to in examining other emerging innovations in DNS Privacy. 

As for the conclusion of the report's investigations on privacy impacts on different user groups and circumventions of the DNS Privacy technologies, the report recommends the following practices. Private individuals could utilise already standardised techniques of DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS, but changing the trusted recursive resolver over an arbitrary interval is recommended. Corporates or organisations could benefit from utilising already-available QNAME minimisation in its DNS recursive resolver but could consider using DNS-over-Tor as presented in the report. For addressing the privacy infringement scenarios, organisations could configure their managed devices to forward all DNS queries over their trusted recursive resolver for avoiding identity leaks.

\subsection{Scientific contribution}
Although there exist other studies of DNS Privacy techniques, this report distinguishes itself by being transparent of the survey method and having provided approaches to categorise the DNS Privacy methods.

\subsection{Current milestone}
The report presented the status of client implementations of different DNS Privacy techniques and progress on the internet standardisations.
Although certain limitations of DNS Privacy methods exist as presented earlier, there is no doubt that DNS Privacy is cruising.

\subsection{Future work}
Due to the limitation of the time, the proof of concept proposal made in this study has not been thoroughly examined.
The actual implementation of the proposal, especially DNS-over-Tor in Phase 2 and examining privacy contribution of using multiple trusted resolver can be done as future studies.
More specifically, future studies could explore the correlation of the privacy contributions and having different intervals for configuring Secure DNS servers (Trusted Recursive Resolvers).

\section{Appendix: Test script for validating DNS Privacy}\label{scriptcode-appendix}
The section presents a set of Python script that can potentially be used in verifying the proof of concept presented in this study.
Sections follow with the code for processing a web site list, script to simulate the web traffic and the common base code for the above functions to work.
Analysing and capturing the generated web traffic is not in the scope of the section.

\subsection{Processing frequently visited web domain list} \label{processweblist}
The website list is fetched from Alexa top one million global charts and further classified depends on Top-Level-Domains (TLDs).
Below is code for a script to convert the Alexa list into a dictionary format.
\inputpython{../Selenium/process_web_list.py}{1}{30}

\subsection{Script for automating the web traffic simulation}
Selenium is the web automation test tool \cite{holmes2006automating}, which is typically used to test web applications. Selenium can be used to visit a list of websites for simulating DNS queries. In the script below, the selenium was incorporated with Firefox Gecko driver to control the web browser through a Python script.

Python 3.5 and higher, Pip3 is required. It is anticipated that Python packages such as selenium and json are also installed on the system. A Gecko driver needs to be reachable in the OS' PATH environment. This code assumes that the Firefox browser is installed on the local PC.
