However, these systems merely transfer trust to a third party. We argue that no single party should be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those queries. To this end, this document specifies Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To accomplish this, ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated these queries. The ODNS experimental protocol is compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.},

A key requirement for these activities is the ability of such malicious user to generate a huge number of node identifiers and possibly choose some of them in order to disrupt availability and integrity in such systems. This paper highlights the problem of Sybil attack and presents a Sybil tracking process to deal with such problem."

The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees. Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
